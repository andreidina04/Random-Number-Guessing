Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! In this simple game, you try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. You will be given a set number of attempts based on the difficulty level you choose.

When you run the game, you will be prompted to choose a difficulty level:

Easy: 10 attempts

Medium: 5 attempts

Hard: 3 attempts

After selecting the difficulty, the game will prompt you to enter your guess.

If your guess is correct, you will be congratulated, and the game ends.

If your guess is incorrect, you will be told whether the correct number is higher or lower than your guess. You will continue guessing until you either guess correctly or run out of attempts.

If you run out of attempts, the game will reveal the correct number and end.
